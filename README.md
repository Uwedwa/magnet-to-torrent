A simple, user-friendly desktop application that allows you to convert magnet links to .torrent files.


## üëæ Features

- Convert magnet links to .torrent files with a simple GUI
- Automatically extracts torrent name from magnet links when available
- Windows compatibility
- Embedded aria2c for reliable metadata extraction
- Progress tracking during conversion
- No installation needed (portable application)



## ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements
Before getting started with magnet-to-torrent, ensure your runtime environment meets the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5
- Internet connection (for first-time setup to download aria2c)

## ‚öôÔ∏èInstallation

### üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Pre-built Binary for Windows

A pre-built binary for Windows is available in the [releases](https://github.com/uwedwa/magnet-to-torrent/releases) section.

### üîß Option 2: **Build from source:**

1. Clone the magnet-to-torrent repository:
```sh
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/Uwedwa/magnet-to-torrent/
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
‚ùØ cd magnet-to-torrent
```

3. Run the application:
```
python magnet_to_torrent_***.py
```

## ü§ñ Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Paste a magnet link in the "Magnet URL" field
3. Choose an output location for the .torrent file or use the "Browse" button
4. Click "Convert" and wait for the process to complete
5. The application will notify you when the conversion is finished

## üß† How It Works

The application uses aria2c to download the torrent metadata from the BitTorrent network based on the magnet link's information. Once the metadata is obtained, it's saved as a .torrent file to your specified location.
